# Tiered Storage with S3 File Gateway

## Case Study

Situation:
A company uses a lot of storage on itâ€™s nfs server on the on premises
network most of which it hardly ever accesses. Surely we can use cloud
computing to save some cost here?

Requirements:
The documents need to be accessible in the usual way with minimal
latency. The company also wonders if we could make the storage more
resilient in case of disaster.

Solution:

We are going to set up a s3 file gateway to implement tiered storage and cross region replication for disaster recovery.

The demo consists of 4 stages, each implementing additional components of the architecture.
- Stage 1: Create & Active the storage gateway
- Stage 2: Create the S3 buckets, storage tiering and cross region replication
- Stage 3: Create a file share
- Stage 4: Mount the storage gateway on your local file system
- Stage 5: Cleanup
